### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p align="justify">I'm a MERN stack developer and blockchain developer currently studying in my second year at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore. As a MERN stack developer, I'm proficient in using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js to build web applications that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.
In addition to my work as a MERN stack developer, I'm also interested in blockchain technology. I've been studying blockchain for some time and have experience working with Ethereum and Solidity to develop smart contracts and decentralized applications. I enjoy contributing to open source projects whenever I can and I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to get involved.</p>

<p align="justify">Overall, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in the world of computer science, and I'm eager to continue exploring new technologies and taking on new challenges as I progress in my education and career.</p>
